# ListTransformer

## Description

`ListTransformer` is a simple Java program that demonstrates how to generate a new list of strings (`list3`) by transforming a list of integers (`list1`) through calculated index lookups in a third list (`list2`).

The transformation logic uses the formula: `index = (value * 2) - 1`



Each value in `list1` is processed with this formula to find an index in `list2`, and the result is added to `list3`.

## How It Works

Given the lists:

- **list1** → List of integers
- **list2** → List of strings
- **list3** → Resultant list of strings generated by looking up `list2`

For each element `n` in `list1`, we compute: `list3[i] = list2[(n * 2) - 1]`


If the calculated index is out of bounds, the program inserts `"Out of bounds!"`.

## Example

```java
list1: [9, 3, 8, 9, 3, 6, 3, 7, 2, 9, 7, 2, 6]
list2: ["YnQ", "Ow2y1", "caG", "1Cnez", "o4Gwl", "u5JtO", "qJ1m", 
        "jK0YA", "6zz", "WGsoy", "8lts1", "Ygt", "DM4R", "slwVc", 
        "cH1Ke", "Xx6vL", "6ex", "IOG"]

list3 (Output): [IOG, u5JtO, Xx6vL, IOG, u5JtO, Ygt, u5JtO, slwVc, 1Cnez, IOG, slwVc, 1Cnez, Ygt]
